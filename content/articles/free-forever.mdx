Yes, you read that right. Optionify is **completely free** — not freemium, not "free with limits," not "free trial." Fully free, forever.

## No Hidden Costs. No Catches.

We believe every Shopify merchant deserves powerful product customization tools, regardless of budget. That's why Optionify offers:

- **All 11 option types** — Text, textarea, radio, switch, checkbox, dropdown, image upload, date picker, email, number, and color
- **Unlimited options** — Create as many as you need
- **Unlimited products** — Apply options to your entire catalog
- **All features unlocked** — Conditional logic, pricing, everything
- **No transaction fees** — We never take a cut of your sales
- **No usage limits** — No caps on orders, views, or anything else

## Why Free?

### Our Philosophy

We built Optionify because we saw merchants struggling with:
- Expensive apps that charge $20-50/month for basic features
- "Free" apps that lock essential features behind paywalls
- Per-transaction fees that eat into margins
- Complicated pricing tiers that punish growth

**We think that's wrong.**

Product options are essential functionality, not a luxury. You shouldn't have to pay monthly fees just to let customers enter their name for engraving or select a delivery date.

### How We Sustain This

Optionify is built and maintained by [Optionify](https://optionify.co), a team passionate about helping Shopify merchants succeed. We sustain development through:
- Optional donations from happy merchants
- Premium support packages for enterprise needs
- Our other Shopify tools and services

The core app will **always remain free** with full functionality.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there really no catch?

No catch. Install the app, use all features, pay nothing. We don't even require a credit card.

### Will you start charging later?

No. The core Optionify app will remain free forever. That's a commitment, not a marketing tactic.

### What if I need support?

Basic support is included free via email. We respond to all merchants, free or not.

### Are there any limits at all?

No artificial limits. Use as many options on as many products as you need. The only limits are Shopify's own platform constraints.

### How do you make money then?

We offer optional premium support packages for merchants who want dedicated assistance, custom development, or priority response times. The app itself remains free.

### What about future features?

New features are added to the free app. We don't hold back features to create paid tiers.
