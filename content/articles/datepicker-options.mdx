Date picker options provide an intuitive calendar interface for customers to select dates. Perfect for scheduling deliveries, planning events, and managing time-sensitive customizations.

## What Are Date Picker Options?

Date picker options create a calendar input field where customers can select specific dates. The date picker provides a user-friendly interface that prevents invalid date entries and allows you to control which dates are available for selection.

Blocked: Weekends
```

```

### Step 2: Configure Date Range Settings

#### Minimum Days from Today

Control how soon customers can select dates:

```
Minimum Days: 3
Result: Today + 3 days minimum
Example: If today is Jan 1, earliest date is Jan 4
```

**Common scenarios:**
- Same day service: 0 days
- Next day: 1 day
- Standard processing: 3-5 days
- Custom production: 7-14 days
- Pre-orders: 30+ days

#### Maximum Days from Today

Limit how far ahead customers can book:

```
Maximum Days: 90
Result: Today + 90 days maximum
Example: If today is Jan 1, latest date is Apr 1
```

**When to set limits:**
- Inventory planning: 60-90 days
- Event bookings: 365 days (1 year)
- Seasonal products: Match season
- No limit: Leave empty for "No maximum"

**Important:** Setting appropriate date ranges helps with:
- Inventory management
- Production scheduling
- Preventing unrealistic expectations
- Managing seasonal availability

### Step 3: Block Unavailable Days

#### Blocked Weekdays

Prevent selection of specific days of the week:

```
Blocked Weekdays: 0, 6
Format: 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday
Example: "0, 6" blocks Sundays and Saturdays
```

**Common patterns:**
- Block weekends: `0, 6`
- Block Sundays only: `0`
- Block Mondays and Wednesdays: `1, 3`
- Business days only: `0, 6` (block weekends)

**Use cases:**
- Match delivery schedules
- Respect shop hours
- Account for shipping carrier schedules
- Align with production days

### Step 4: Validation & Error Messages

#### Custom Error Messages

Provide clear feedback when customers select invalid dates:

```
Custom Error Message: "Please select a valid date"
```

**Better examples:**
- ✅ "Please select a date at least 3 days from today"
- ✅ "Sorry, we don't deliver on weekends. Please choose a weekday"
- ✅ "Pickup dates must be within the next 90 days"
- ❌ "Invalid date"
- ❌ "Error"

The error message appears when:
- Date is too soon (before minimum)
- Date is too far (after maximum)
- Date falls on blocked weekday
- Customer tries to proceed without selecting a date (if required)

### Step 5: Required vs Optional

**Make it required when:**
- Date is critical for fulfillment
- You need to plan production/delivery
- The product is time-sensitive

**Make it optional when:**
- Date is just a preference
- Flexible fulfillment timing
- Customer may not know exact date

```
Required: Yes (for critical scheduling)
Required: No (for flexible preferences)
```

## Advanced Features

### Date Format Display

Dates display in customer's local format:
- US: MM/DD/YYYY
- Europe: DD/MM/YYYY
- ISO: YYYY-MM-DD

Optionify automatically handles localization based on customer location.

### Calendar Interface

- Visual calendar view
- Month/year navigation
- Disabled date indicators
- Today highlight
- Clear visual feedback

### Mobile Optimization

On mobile devices:
- Native date picker integration
- Touch-friendly calendar

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Labels

**Good labels:**
- ✅ "Preferred Delivery Date"
- ✅ "Event Date for Your Custom Order"
- ✅ "Pick Up Date (available 3+ days out)"

**Poor labels:**
- ❌ "Date"
- ❌ "Select Date"
- ❌ "Date Option 1"

### 2. Helpful Help Text

Explain what the date means:

```
Help Text: "Select your preferred delivery date.
Orders require 3 business days processing.
We don't deliver on weekends."
```

### 3. Realistic Minimums

Set minimums that account for:
- Production time
- Shipping time
- Processing time
- Buffer for issues

**Example:** If you need 2 days to make a product and 1 day to ship, set minimum to 3-4 days for safety.

### 4. Communicate Blocked Days

Tell customers why days are blocked:

```
Help Text: "We don't deliver on Sundays or Mondays.
Please select Tuesday-Saturday."
```

### 5. Plan for Holidays

Consider blocking major holidays:
- Add to help text: "Holiday shipping may be delayed"
- Use maximum date to avoid holiday rush
- Communicate processing times clearly

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Minimum Too Short

**Problem:** Customer selects tomorrow, but you need 5 days
**Solution:** Set minimum days accurately

### ❌ No Maximum Set

**Problem:** Customer books 2 years ahead
**Solution:** Set realistic maximum based on planning horizon

### ❌ Unclear Blocked Days

**Problem:** Customer doesn't know why certain days are disabled
**Solution:** Explain in help text and error messages

### ❌ No Buffer Time

**Problem:** Minimum is exactly production time with no margin
**Solution:** Add 1-2 day buffer for unexpected issues

### ❌ Wrong Option Type

**Problem:** Need date AND time
**Solution:** Consider adding a separate time picker or text field
