See how real Shopify stores use Optionify to increase their average order value. These case studies show proven strategies you can apply to your own store.

## Why Product Options Increase AOV

Before diving into examples, understand the psychology:

- **Upsells at decision point** — Customer already committed to buying
- **Bundled value** — Add-ons feel like deals, not extra costs
- **Personalization premium** — Custom items command higher prices
- **Reduced friction** — One-click additions vs. navigating to new products

## Common Patterns Across All Case Studies

### 1. The Magic Number: 3-4 Option Groups

Every successful store used 3-4 distinct option categories:
- Personalization/Customization
- Quality/Size upgrades
- Add-ons/Bundles
- Services/Protection

### 2. Free + Paid Combination

Always include at least one free option alongside paid ones:
- Free gift message + Paid gift wrapping
- Standard shipping + Paid rush delivery
- Basic product + Premium upgrades

### 3. Price Anchoring

Show the premium option first or highlight the "most popular" mid-tier:

```
❌ Wrong Order:
- Basic ($0)
- Better (+$10)
- Best (+$25)

✅ Right Order:
- Best (+$25) ← "Most Popular"
- Better (+$10)
- Basic (Included)
```

### 4. Conditional Logic

Don't show everything at once. Use [conditional logic](/articles/conditional-logic) to reveal relevant options:

```
If "Gift" is selected:
  → Show gift message
  → Show gift wrapping
  → Show delivery date picker
```
