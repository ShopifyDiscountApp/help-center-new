Radio button options allow customers to select exactly one choice from multiple options. Perfect for size selection, style choices, and any scenario where customers must pick a single option from a set of mutually exclusive choices.

## What Are Radio Button Options?

Radio buttons create a set of options where customers can select only one choice at a time. When a customer clicks a different option, the previous selection is automatically deselected. This makes radio buttons ideal for exclusive choices where only one answer is possible.

### Step 2: Add Option Values

Add the choices customers can select from:

```
Value 1: Standard Shipping
Value 2: Express Shipping
Value 3: Overnight Shipping
```

**Tips for option values:**
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Keep them concise (2-4 words ideal)
- Make differences obvious
- Include key information (timing, features)

### Step 3: Configure Display Settings

#### Display Style

Choose how radio buttons appear:

**Button Group (Recommended)**
- Modern, clickable buttons
- Clear visual selection
- Better mobile experience
- Professional appearance
- Shows pricing inline

**Traditional Radio Buttons**
- Classic circular selectors
- Familiar interface
- Compact display
- Good for long lists

The Button Group style shown in the screenshot provides a clean, modern look that works well with pricing display.

#### Layout Options

**Horizontal Layout**
```
Display: Side by side
Best for: 2-4 short options
Example: Male | Female | Unisex
```

**Vertical Layout**
```
Display: Stacked
Best for: 3+ options, long option names
Example:
○ Standard Shipping (5-7 days)
○ Express (2-3 days)
○ Overnight (next day)
```

**Grid Layout**
```
Display: Multi-column grid
Best for: 4+ options with images or icons
```

### Step 4: Set Default Selection

Choose which option is pre-selected when customers view the product:

```
Default Selection: Male
```

**When to set defaults:**
- ✅ Most popular choice
- ✅ Standard/basic option
- ✅ Free option (if others have charges)
- ✅ When one choice fits majority of customers

**When NOT to set defaults:**
- ❌ When you need explicit customer choice
- ❌ All options are equally important
- ❌ Forcing a selection prevents mistakes

### Step 5: Add Pricing to Options

Each radio option can have its own price:

```
Male: +₼1.00
Female: +₼1.00
Unisex: No additional charge
```

**Pricing strategies:**
- Base option: $0 additional
- Premium options: Add upcharge
- Different costs: Reflect actual cost differences
- Free vs paid: Make free option clear

**Price display formats:**
```
Custom Format: (+{symbol}{price})
Example: (+$5.00)
Example: (+₼1.00)
```

The pricing automatically displays next to each option as shown in the screenshot.

### Step 6: Required vs Optional

**Make it required when:**
- Customer MUST make a choice
- No default covers all scenarios
- Critical for fulfillment

**Make it optional when:**
- Default choice works for most
- Not essential to order
- Customer may prefer not to choose

```
Required: Yes (forces selection before checkout)
Required: No (default value used if not changed)
```

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Logic

- Percentage increase (+15%)
- Price subtraction (discount)
- No price change ($0)

## Best Practices

### 1. Limit Number of Options

**Ideal:** 2-5 options
**Maximum:** 8 options (use dropdown beyond this)

Too many radio buttons:
- Overwhelm customers
- Take up too much space
- Slow decision making

### 2. Clear, Distinct Labels

**Good labels:**
- ✅ "Standard Shipping (5-7 business days)"
- ✅ "Men's Fit"
- ✅ "No Gift Wrapping"

**Poor labels:**
- ❌ "Option 1", "Option 2"
- ❌ "A", "B", "C"
- ❌ Unclear abbreviations

### 3. Show Pricing Clearly

Make costs obvious:
```
✅ Express Shipping (+$10.00)
✅ Premium Quality (+$15.00)
✅ Standard (Free)

❌ Express Shipping (check price at checkout)
❌ Premium Quality (extra)
```

### 4. Logical Order

Order options by:
- Most to least popular
- Least to most expensive
- Logical progression (Small → Large)
- Alphabetical (if no other logic)

### 5. Helpful Help Text

Explain when needed:
```
Help Text: "Select your size. If between sizes, we recommend sizing up."
```

### 6. Consider Default Impact

Defaults have high selection rates:
- 50-70% of customers keep defaults
- Set defaults strategically
- Use defaults for recommendations
- Don't default to expensive options without reason

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too Many Options

**Problem:** 15 radio buttons for country selection
**Solution:** Use dropdown for long lists

### ❌ Unclear Differences

**Problem:** "Option A" vs "Option B"
**Solution:** Use descriptive names showing difference

### ❌ Hidden Costs

**Problem:** Pricing not shown until checkout
**Solution:** Display all pricing with options

### ❌ Wrong Default

**Problem:** Most expensive option pre-selected
**Solution:** Default to most popular or standard option

### ❌ Using Checkboxes Instead

**Problem:** Checkboxes when only one choice allowed
**Solution:** Radio buttons for single selection, checkboxes for multiple

### ❌ No Visual Feedback

**Problem:** Unclear which option is selected
**Solution:** Use Button Group style with clear selection state
