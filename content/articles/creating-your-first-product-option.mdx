Ready to create your first custom product option? This tutorial will guide you through the entire process with a practical example: adding a gift message option to your products.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

- ✅ Installed Optionify on your Shopify store
- ✅ Completed the initial setup wizard
- ✅ Have at least one product in your store


## Step 1: Access the Option Creator

1. Open your Shopify admin panel
2. Navigate to **Apps** → **Optionify**
3. Click the **Create New Option** button in the dashboard

*The "Create New Option" button is prominently displayed on the dashboard*

You'll be taken to the Option Builder interface.

## Step 2: Choose Your Option Type

The first step is selecting which type of option you want to create.

For our gift message example, we'll use **Text** (single-line input):

1. Click on the **Text** option type card
2. The builder will update to show text-specific settings

\![Option type selection screen](/images/creating-first-option/option-type-selection.png)
*Choose from 11 different option types based on your needs*

### Quick Option Type Reference

- **Text**: Short one-line input (names, messages)
- **Textarea**: Multi-line input (longer messages, instructions)
- **Radio**: Choose one from several options
- **Checkbox**: Select multiple items
- **Dropdown**: Choose from a dropdown menu


## Step 3: Configure Basic Settings

Now you'll set up the core details of your option:

### Option Label

This is what customers will see. For our example:

```
Gift Message (Optional)
```

**Best practices for labels:**
- Be clear and descriptive
- Indicate if optional or required
- Keep it under 50 characters
- Use sentence case

### Internal Name

This helps you identify the option in your admin:

```
gift-message-text
```

**Naming conventions:**
- Use lowercase
- Separate words with hyphens
- Keep it descriptive
- Avoid special characters

\![Basic settings configuration panel](/images/creating-first-option/basic-settings.png)
*Fill in the option label and internal name*

### Help Text (Optional)

Add guidance for customers:

```
Add a personalized message for the gift recipient (max 100 characters)
```

This appears below the input field to guide customers.

## Step 4: Configure Option-Specific Settings

Each option type has unique settings. For Text options:

### Character Limit

Set a maximum character count:
- **Enabled**: Yes
- **Max Characters**: 100


### Placeholder Text

Example text that appears before the customer types:

```
e.g., "Happy Birthday, Sarah!"
```

### Validation

- **Required**: No (this is optional)
- **Minimum Length**: 0
- **Pattern**: None (accepts all characters)

\![Text option specific settings](/images/creating-first-option/text-settings.png)
*Configure character limits, placeholders, and validation rules*

## Step 5: Set Up Assignment

This is where you choose which products will show this option.

### Assignment Type Options

1. **All Products**: Shows on every product (rarely recommended)
2. **Tagged Products**: Shows on products with specific tags
3. **Collections**: Shows on products in specific collections
4. **Individual Products**: Shows only on selected products

For our gift message example, let's use **Tagged Products**:

1. Select **Tagged Products**
2. Enter tag: `gift-wrappable`
3. Click **Add Tag**

\![Assignment configuration screen](/images/creating-first-option/assignment-setup.png)
*Choose where this option will appear in your store*


### Tagging Products

To add the tag to products:

1. Go to **Products** in Shopify admin
2. Select a product
3. In the **Tags** field, add: `gift-wrappable`
4. Save the product

## Step 6: Configure Pricing (Optional)

You can add a charge for this option if desired.

For a free gift message:
- **Add Price**: No

For a paid service (like premium gift wrapping):
- **Add Price**: Yes
- **Price**: $5.00
- **Price Label**: "Gift Wrapping Service"

\![Pricing configuration options](/images/creating-first-option/pricing-config.png)
*Optionally add extra charges for premium services*


## Step 7: Set Display Order

If you have multiple options on a product, control the order they appear:

- **Display Order**: 1 (appears first)

Lower numbers appear higher on the product page.

## Step 8: Preview Your Option

Before saving, use the preview panel to see how it will look:

\![Live preview of the option](/images/creating-first-option/option-preview.png)
*The preview shows exactly how customers will see your option*

### Check:
- Label displays correctly
- Help text is clear
- Placeholder text is helpful
- Field accepts input properly

## Step 9: Save and Activate

When everything looks good:

1. Click **Save Option**
2. Toggle **Active** to ON
3. Click **Publish**

\![Save and activate buttons](/images/creating-first-option/save-activate.png)
*Save your option and activate it to make it live on your store*


## Step 10: Test Your Option

Always test before announcing to customers:

### Testing Checklist

1. **Visit a Tagged Product**
   - Go to your store's frontend
   - Navigate to a product with the `gift-wrappable` tag
   - Verify the option appears

2. **Test Input**
   - Type a test message
   - Verify character counter works
   - Check placeholder disappears

3. **Add to Cart**
   - Add the product to cart
   - Verify the gift message shows in cart
   - Check the option data persists

4. **Place Test Order**
   - Complete a test purchase

   - Verify gift message appears in order details

5. **Mobile Testing**
   - Test on a mobile device
   - Ensure responsive design works
   - Verify input is easy to use

## Viewing Option Data in Orders

When customers place orders with your option:

1. Go to **Orders** in Shopify admin
2. Open an order
3. Look for **Option Data** or **Custom Fields** section
4. You'll see: "Gift Message: [customer's message]"
